# Digital Witness Alliance – Public Repository

> **We witness. We remember. We resist.**

This repository hosts the **public-facing content** and collaborative architecture of the **Digital Witness Alliance** — an initiative dedicated to preserving human dignity, memory, and ethical clarity in an age of systemic erasure and digital propaganda.

## 🌐 Purpose & Scope

This repo focuses on:

- **Content Curation & Archiving**
- **Digital Memory Infrastructure**
- **Thematic Storytelling & Strategic Design**
- **Collaboration and Community Input**

It acts as a **permanent digital record** for stories, cases, thought pieces, and open-source knowledge to fight against amnesia, denial, and digital whitewashing.

## 🧭 Linked Operational Repository

The **deployment, integration, and operational scripts** (including WordPress sync, server access, and environmental tooling) are maintained separately under:

- Database connection debugging
- Admin upgrade routines
- Cross-project release tagging and documentation

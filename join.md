## Join Us – Beyond Borders, Beyond Labels

You do not need to be a journalist, a developer, or an academic.

You only need to believe this:  
> That no life is worth less.  
> That no suffering should go unseen.  
> That silence is not neutrality.

We invite you to contribute — regardless of your:
- Ethnicity (Arab, Kurd, Turk, Armenian, Persian, etc.)
- Religion or belief (or lack of)
- Language or nationality
- Education level or digital skill

### ✊ Who Can Join?

- Witnesses who want to document injustice
- Writers who can capture memory
- Translators who can bridge voices
- Designers who care about message and impact
- Developers who want to build tools for truth

### 🌍 Why We Do This

The systems we live in are optimized for profit — not humanity.  
We are building an archive of **truth and conscience** that no algorithm can erase.

Every line of code, every article, every translated word adds to this living record.

**You matter. Your voice matters. Let it be part of something that resists forgetting.**

> We are not here to be loud.  
> We are here to be clear.
